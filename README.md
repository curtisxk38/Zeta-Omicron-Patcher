Zeta-Omicron-Patcher
====================
A simple python program to patch zeta/omicron (see:http://www.pokemonzetaomicron.com/)
Written to learn a bit of file management and for personal use

First put the python file into a directory containg the patch folder and the main game folder.
Then launch from command line by navigating to that directory and executing:
>python "zetaomicron patcher.py" "Name of Patch Folder" "Name of Main Folder"

Or, after putting it in the right directory, you can just normally launch it and it will prompt you to type in the names of the folders.
